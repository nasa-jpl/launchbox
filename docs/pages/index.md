# Welcome

## What is Launchbox?

Launchbox is a runtime environment for web applications.
It currently supports Python-based apps and static websites.

:warning: Launchbox is currently a **beta** product. **Do not use in production!**


## What is it good for?

Here are some examples of how Launchbox could be used:

- Add a CMS with a custom theme and let anyone in your organization create their own website
  from a shared codebase, no coding necessary
- As a local development environment, rapidly spin up local test sites with isolated databases
- Consolidated hosting of any number of static sites â€“ like a self-hosted GitHub Pages kind of service


## How do I get started?

If you have Docker installed, setting up a local environment to test out Launchbox is a breeze.
[Check out our setup guide](setup/) to get it going.

[View the Core Concepts page](concepts/) to learn the basics of how Launchbox works
and how you can set up your own site or application to run on it.
